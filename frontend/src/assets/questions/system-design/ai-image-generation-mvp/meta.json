  "title": "AI Image Generation MVP (Two-Week Design)",
  "description": "Design a two-week MVP for integrating an image-generating AI into a mobile or web app. Focus on the frontend UX, the async backend workflow, and how you would ship a usable feature quickly with clear trade-offs.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Prompt input, generation states, and error handling.\n- Long-running job flow (polling, WebSocket, or SSE).\n- Storage of generated images (object storage + metadata DB).\n- Minimal scope for a two-week delivery: core flow over polish.\n- Safety and retries when the model fails or times out.\n\nYou should be prepared to talk about: UX states, API contract, job status, and what you would defer to a later iteration.",
