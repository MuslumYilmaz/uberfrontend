Focus on achieving smooth scrolling, clear loading/error states, and keeping DOM size reasonable as the list grows.\n\nKey considerations include: when to load more data, how to detect scroll boundaries efficiently, how to show skeleton placeholders without causing layout jumps, and when it becomes necessary to introduce list virtualization.",
