  "description": "Design a live line chart that updates roughly every 500ms (e.g. streaming metrics, stock prices, telemetry). Focus purely on the frontend side: how to feed data into the chart, render updates efficiently, and keep the UI smooth over time.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Decide between incremental updates (append/shift points) vs full redraw for each tick.\n- Understand the trade-offs between using a charting library (ECharts, Chart.js, etc.) and custom canvas/WebGL rendering.\n- Design a requestAnimationFrame loop (or equivalent) so rendering stays smooth without over-drawing.\n- Consider using OffscreenCanvas and/or Web Workers to offload heavy work away from the main thread.\n\nYou should be prepared to talk about: memory management as data grows (windowing / sliding buffer), how to handle bursts of updates (queueing vs dropping frames), how to avoid blocking the main thread, and strategies like downsampling/aggregation for very large datasets so the chart stays responsive even after running for a long time.",
