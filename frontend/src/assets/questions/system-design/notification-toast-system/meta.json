  "description": "Design a global notification toast system that can be triggered from anywhere in the app (e.g. `toast.success()`, `toast.error()`). Focus on global state management, rendering via portals, stacking multiple toasts, auto-dismiss timers, and accessible behavior.\n\nFunctional requirements:\n- Expose a simple API like `toast.success(message, options?)`, `toast.error(...)`, `toast.info(...)`.\n- Display one or more toast messages over the UI without breaking the layout.\n- Support variants (success / error / warning / info) with different visual styles.\n- Automatically dismiss toasts after a configurable timeout.\n- Allow manual dismiss (close button / click) that cancels the timer.\n- Stack multiple toasts in a defined order (e.g. newest on top).\n- Support different placements: top-right, top-center, bottom-right, bottom-left; on mobile, optionally full-width.\n\nNon-functional:\n- Global API must work from any part of the app without prop-drilling.\n- No memory leaks from timers or event listeners (proper cleanup on unmount).\n- Correct z-index behavior so toasts appear above regular content but below critical modals if desired.\n- Performant even when many toasts are fired in quick succession.\n- Good accessibility: ARIA roles, screen reader announcements, focus handling for interactive toasts.\n\nData / state considerations:\n- Each toast has: id, type (success/error/warning/info), message, optional description, createdAt, timeout, placement and optional actions.\n- Global toast state is managed in a single place (store, context, or event bus) and rendered through a top-level portal.\n- Timers and dismissal logic are tied to toast IDs so that updates/removals are predictable.\n",
