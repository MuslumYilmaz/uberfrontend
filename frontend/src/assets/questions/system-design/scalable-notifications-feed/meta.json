    "description": "Design a real-time notifications feed that can handle millions of updates without overwhelming the UI. Focus on how the frontend subscribes to updates (WebSocket/SSE/polling), how to buffer and batch incoming events, how to render a large feed efficiently, and how to keep the UI responsive under heavy load.\n\nFunctional requirements:\n- Receive new notifications in real time (push or polling).\n- Render a scrollable feed with new items appearing at the top.\n- Support read/unread state, clear-all, and basic filtering (e.g., only mentions).\n- Show a badge/count for unseen notifications.\n- Handle network errors and reconnects gracefully.\n\nNon-functional:\n- Avoid re-render storms when bursts of events arrive.\n- Keep memory and DOM size bounded (virtualization, trimming).\n- Maintain smooth scrolling (60 FPS target).\n- Be resilient to slow devices and unstable networks.\n\nData / state considerations:\n- Notification objects include id, type, content, timestamp, read/unread, and optional actions.\n- A small client-side buffer queues incoming events before render.\n- A view model layer maintains a bounded list (latest N) plus metadata like unreadCount and lastSeenCursor.",
