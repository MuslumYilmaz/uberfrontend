    <!-- Opening -->
    <p>
      Front-end interviews often feel like a lottery. One company throws you an
      algorithm, the next wants you to build a modal from scratch, and a third
      quizzes you on obscure browser details. It’s easy to think there’s no pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      But underneath, most interviewers are looking for the same core signals:
      <strong>can you ship a working solution under time pressure, explain your
      choices clearly, and show that you think like an engineer who cares about the
      end-user?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      That means the exact question matters less than how you approach it. Do you
      break problems down? Do you communicate trade-offs? Do you balance speed with
      correctness? These are the threads that run through every round.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide exists to cut through the noise: we’ll map out the formats you’re
      likely to face, what each one is really testing, and how to prep in a way that
      builds confidence instead of burnout.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <h2>The big picture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There’s no universal format — expect a mix of coding, UI builds, debugging, and system design.</li>
      <li>Trend: less whiteboard puzzles, more domain-relevant tasks (widgets, JS utilities, async/state bugs).</li>
      <li>What matters most: correctness → clarity → reasoning → trade-offs → communication.</li>
      <li>Interviews are not just about “knowing stuff” — they’re about <em>showing how you think under pressure</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Almost every loop has a coding exercise. You might need to build a small
      UI widget (modal, dropdown, autocomplete) or implement a JavaScript helper
      (<code>debounce</code>, <code>memoize</code>). Interviewers want to see if you
      can <strong>ship something working under time pressure</strong>.
    </p>
    <ol class="step-list">
      <li>Get to a working MVP first, then polish if there’s time.</li>
      <li>Work incrementally — show progress in small steps.</li>
      <li>Think about edge cases early (empty input, async errors, large data sets).</li>
      <li>Explain your thought process instead of silently coding.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a [routerLink]="['/guides','system-design']">System design (senior+)</a></h3>
    <p>
      For mid–senior candidates, system design is often the deciding round. Instead
      of backend scaling, you’ll focus on <strong>front-end architecture</strong>:
      how components talk to each other, where state lives, and how you handle
      performance and accessibility trade-offs.
    </p>
    <ol class="step-list">
      <li>Define the MVP clearly so you don’t overbuild.</li>
      <li>Show how you’d organize state and data flow (local vs global, sync vs async).</li>
      <li>Call out performance considerations (caching layers, code-splitting).</li>
      <li>Bake in accessibility from the start, not as an afterthought.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Quiz / knowledge checks</h3>
    <p>
      These are short questions sprinkled in to test fundamentals. Expect things like:
      “How does the rendering pipeline work?” or “What’s the difference between
      <code>async</code> and <code>defer</code>?”. It’s about showing <strong>solid mental models</strong>,
      not memorizing obscure trivia.
    </p>
    <ol class="step-list">
      <li>Be ready to explain event loop, rendering, CSS cascade, caching, and security basics.</li>
      <li>Create a 1-page cheatsheet and practice recall, not just recognition.</li>
      <li>Focus on clarity and confidence — you don’t need every edge case.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Behavioral</h3>
    <p>
      Many candidates underestimate this round, but hiring managers weigh it heavily.
      They want to know: can you <strong>work well with others under ambiguity</strong>?
    </p>
    <ol class="step-list">
      <li>Prepare 5–6 STAR stories (Situation, Task, Action, Result) around conflict, failure, learning, leadership, and speed.</li>
      <li>Be concrete — instead of “we improved performance,” say “we reduced LCP from 6s → 3s with lazy loading.”</li>
      <li>Keep each story short: 2–3 minutes with a clear takeaway.</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <h2>What interviewers actually score</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Correctness & scope control:</strong> you ship something working, even if minimal.</li>
      <li><strong>Code quality under time:</strong> readable names, small functions, no unnecessary complexity.</li>
      <li><strong>Reasoning & trade-offs:</strong> why debounce over throttle, why SW cache vs server cache.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication:</strong> you narrate intent, invite hints, and self-test your work.</li>
      <li><strong>Product & accessibility sense:</strong> sensible defaults, keyboard navigation, basic ARIA.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <h2>Typical hiring process</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Recruiter call (20–30 min).</strong>  
        A quick conversation about your background and motivation.  
        Expect light screening questions (e.g., “What’s the difference between var, let, const?”).  
        Purpose: check you’re a fit on paper and can communicate well.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Online assessment / take-home.</strong>  
        Usually a timed quiz (30–60 min) or a small project you submit in a few days.  
        They want to see your *raw coding ability* without interview pressure.  
        Tip: keep your solution simple and easy to read — don’t over-engineer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Phone screen / virtual interview (45–60 min).</strong>  
        A live coding task with an engineer.  
        You’ll likely implement a small UI widget or JS helper, while talking through your approach.  
        This is where narration matters: share your thinking instead of silently typing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onsite / interview loop (half-day to full-day).</strong>  
        Multiple rounds back-to-back:  
        - **Coding** (bigger task or multiple small ones).  
        - **System design** (for senior roles: architecture, state, data flow).  
        - **Behavioral** (team fit, communication, past experiences).  
        Tip: bring steady energy — consistency across rounds matters as much as nailing one.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      💡 Pro tip: Always ask your recruiter for the exact breakdown of rounds.  
      Many companies even send prep material — if they offer, *use it*. It shows initiative and helps you focus your practice.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <h2>Strategic prep habits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Baseline fluency.</strong>  
        Be able to explain and use closures, promises, async/await, the event loop, DOM APIs, and CSS layout without hesitation.  
        Tip: practice writing 10–15 line snippets from memory (e.g., a throttled scroll listener) until it feels automatic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>UI reps.</strong>  
        Rebuild common widgets (modal, dropdown, autocomplete, virtual list) under a 30–45 min timer.  
        Focus on: shipping a minimal working version first, then adding keyboard navigation and a11y basics.  
        This simulates interview pressure and shows you can prioritize correctly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Design drills.</strong>  
        Take a common feature (chat app, dashboard filter panel, date picker) and sketch:  
        1) what goes in local vs global state, 2) what data flows between components, 3) which props/events are needed.  
        These 15–20 min exercises sharpen your system design thinking for FE roles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mocks.</strong>  
        Run 45-min practice interviews with a friend or record yourself.  
        Play back to check: did you narrate clearly, did you jump to code too soon, did you confirm requirements?  
        Self-review is often more revealing than extra practice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Behavioral.</strong>  
        Prepare 5–6 STAR stories (Situation, Task, Action, Result) around failure, conflict, learning, leadership, and impact.  
        Keep answers 2–3 minutes — long enough for depth, short enough to leave room for follow-ups.  
        Bonus: practice linking stories back to front-end context (e.g., “we fixed a perf bug by reducing bundle size”).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section 5b -->
    <h2>High-value topics to prepare</h2>
    <p>
      Front-end interviews don’t expect you to know everything — but some topics show
      up over and over. Here’s a cheat sheet of where to focus your energy:
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Area</th>
          <th>Core Topics</th>
          <th>Why it matters</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>JavaScript</strong></td>
          <td>Closures, async/await, promises, this binding, prototypes</td>
          <td>Shows you can reason about async code and avoid hidden bugs.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Browser</strong></td>
          <td>Event loop, rendering pipeline, repaint/reflow, local/session storage</td>
          <td>Core to debugging performance issues and explaining “why the page feels slow.”</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>CSS & Layout</strong></td>
          <td>Flexbox, Grid, stacking context, positioning, responsive units</td>
          <td>Nearly every UI task involves layout — fluency here = speed in interviews.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>DOM & APIs</strong></td>
          <td>querySelector, event delegation, classList, fetch, IntersectionObserver</td>
          <td>Most practical tasks require manipulating the DOM without frameworks.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Accessibility</strong></td>
          <td>Keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, focus management, color contrast</td>
          <td>Interviewers notice instantly if you ignore accessibility — it’s a correctness issue.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>System Design (FE)</strong></td>
          <td>State management, component APIs, caching, code splitting, error/loading states</td>
          <td>Critical for senior roles — separates mid-level from senior candidates.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Testing</strong></td>
          <td>Unit vs integration, mocking APIs, snapshot tests</td>
          <td>Signals maturity: you think beyond “happy path” coding.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

<p>
  📌 Use this table as a <strong>study checklist</strong>: tick off one row at a time, and you’ll
  cover 80% of what interviewers actually care about.
</p>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <h2>Resume preparation</h2>
    <p>
      Your resume won’t land you the job on its own, but it’s the gatekeeper —
      if it doesn’t pass the first screen, you’ll never get to show your skills in an interview.
      The goal is simple: make it <strong>impossible to miss your front-end impact</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Show impact, not tasks.</strong> Replace “Built a component library” with
        “Shipped a design system adopted by 3 teams, cut duplicate CSS by 60%.”</li>
      <li><strong>Use numbers wherever possible.</strong> “Reduced LCP from 5s → 2.8s”
        or “Improved bundle size by 35%” are signals recruiters and engineers immediately understand.</li>
      <li><strong>Prioritize relevance.</strong> Front-end performance, accessibility wins, design system work,
        or tricky UI challenges should always come before generic responsibilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep it lean.</strong> 1 page if you’re under 10 years of experience, 2 max otherwise.
        Less is more — clarity and scannability beat a laundry list of bullets.</li>
      <li><strong>Tailor for the role.</strong> If you’re applying to a React-heavy role, highlight React work first.
        Same for Angular, Vue, or TypeScript.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

      <a [routerLink]="['/guides','playbook','resume']">resume guide</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 7 -->
    <h2>Execution patterns worth remembering</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>ICE – Inputs, Constraints, Examples.</strong><br />
        Before you write a single line of code, slow down and do three things out loud:
        <ol>
          <li>Repeat the <em>input</em> you’re given.</li>
          <li>Clarify the <em>constraints</em> (time limits, data size, edge cases).</li>
          <li>Walk through a couple of <em>examples</em> to be sure you and the interviewer see it the same way.</li>
        </ol>
        This buys you time, reduces miscommunication, and shows you think systematically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>RED – Read, Explain, Do.</strong><br />
        When debugging or reading unfamiliar code:
        <ol>
          <li><em>Read</em> the snippet slowly.</li>
          <li><em>Explain</em> what you think it does, line by line, in plain words.</li>
          <li><em>Do</em> the fix or the next step.</li>
        </ol>
        Interviewers love this because they can follow your thought process instead of waiting for silence to break.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>RAC – Result, Approach, Complexity.</strong><br />
        At the end of any coding question, wrap up with a 30-second summary:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Result:</em> what works now and which edge cases you covered.</li>
          <li><em>Approach:</em> the main idea you used, and why.</li>
          <li><em>Complexity:</em> the rough runtime/space costs, plus what you’d improve if you had more time.</li>
        </ul>
        This leaves the interviewer with confidence that you know what you did and how it scales.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section 8 -->
    <h2>4-week prep plan (lightweight)</h2>
    <p>
      If you’ve only got a month, here’s a focused schedule that builds skills layer by layer.
      The goal isn’t perfection — it’s consistency and confidence across the question types that actually show up.
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Week</th>
          <th>Focus</th>
          <th>Daily reps</th>
          <th>Why it matters</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>1</strong></td>
          <td>JS + Browser fundamentals</td>
          <td>Do 3 quick quiz cards + 1 small JS utility each day</td>
          <td>Sharp recall of event loop, async/await, DOM quirks means less panic when you see trivia or debugging prompts.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>2</strong></td>
          <td>UI components</td>
          <td>Build 1 component/day (modal, dropdown, autocomplete) with keyboard support</td>
          <td>Most companies test if you can ship usable UI fast. By the end of this week you’ll have a toolkit of reusable patterns in your muscle memory.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>3</strong></td>
          <td>System design (FE)</td>
          <td>Take 1 design prompt → sketch a diagram → write a 5–6 line summary</td>
          <td>Prevents blank stares in senior interviews. Practicing diagrams trains you to explain data flow, state, and trade-offs under time pressure.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>4</strong></td>
          <td>Mocks & review</td>
          <td>Do 2 × 45-min practice interviews + write retro notes</td>
          <td>Builds interview stamina. Reviewing your mistakes here saves you from repeating them in the real loop.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

<p>
  💡 Pro tip: Don’t cram. Even 30–45 minutes a day beats a single 6-hour binge.
  Treat this plan like a workout routine — small, consistent reps compound.
</p>

    <!-- Section 9 -->
    <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Over-indexing on LeetCode.</strong>  
        Many candidates spend 80% of their prep on algorithms that rarely appear in FE interviews.  
        Shift at least half of that time to UI coding, debugging, and system design — where you’ll actually be tested.
      </li>

        <strong>Coding in silence.</strong>  
        Interviewers can’t grade what they can’t hear. If you don’t narrate your thought process, they may assume you’re stuck.  
        Even saying out loud “I’ll start with a basic version, then handle errors” shows structure and confidence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Polishing before shipping.</strong>  
        Spending 20 minutes on pixel-perfect CSS while the core logic is incomplete is a red flag.  
        Always ship a working MVP first, then layer improvements if time allows.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Treating accessibility as optional.</strong>  
        Keyboard support and basic ARIA roles are table stakes.  
        Interviewers notice when you add <code>aria-label</code> or trap focus in a modal — it signals real-world experience.

    <p>
      Prepping can feel overwhelming, but remember — this platform is built to
      help you practice the exact interview skills you’ve just read about.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><a [routerLink]="['/coding']">Coding practice</a>:</strong> Tackle real
        front-end coding challenges with our editor, from small utilities
        (<code>debounce</code>, <code>memoize</code>) to full UI widgets. Get instant
        feedback as if you were in a live round.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a [routerLink]="['/guides','system-design']">System design drills</a>:</strong>
        Walk through structured prompts for client-side design problems —
        caching, state modeling, performance trade-offs. We’ll nudge you to cover
        MVP first, then scale up.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a [routerLink]="['/trivia']">Trivia & quick checks</a>:</strong>
        Short quiz-style questions on JavaScript, CSS, browsers, and HTTP. Great for
        filling idle 10-minute blocks and strengthening recall.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a [routerLink]="['/behavioral']">Behavioral prep</a>:</strong> STAR templates
        and reflection prompts to help you build strong stories (failure, conflict,
        leadership, learning).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      👉 In short: don’t just read — practice here, review your mistakes, and
      build interview muscle memory before the real thing.
