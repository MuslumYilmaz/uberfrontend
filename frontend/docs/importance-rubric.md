# Importance Rubric (Legacy)

The previous offline importance rubric tooling has been decommissioned.

Current state:

- `importance` remains a static field in question datasets.
- `difficulty` remains explicitly authored (`easy | intermediate | hard`).
- No rubric CLI is used in the active workflow.

This document is kept only as historical context.
