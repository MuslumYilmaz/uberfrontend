        <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files that are downloaded to your device when you visit a website.
          They are widely used to make websites work or to improve their efficiency, as well as to
          provide reporting information and personalized experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies set by the website owner are called “first-party cookies.” Cookies set by parties
          other than the website owner are called “third-party cookies.” Third-party cookies enable
          third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (such as
          analytics, advertising, and social media integrations).

        <h2>2. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Essential Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies are strictly necessary for the website to function properly. They allow you to
          log in, use essential features, and navigate pages securely. Without them, certain parts of
          the website would not operate as intended.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Performance and Analytics Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          We use analytics cookies to understand how users interact with our website. They help us
          measure traffic sources, identify popular pages, and improve usability. For example, we may
          use Google Analytics to gather anonymized usage statistics.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Functional Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Functional cookies remember your preferences and settings — such as language choice, theme,
          or saved login state — to make your experience more personalized.
        </p>

        <h3>2.4 Advertising and Targeting Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          We may use advertising cookies to deliver more relevant ads to you, both on our website and
          across other platforms. These cookies track browsing habits to infer interests. You can opt
          out through your browser or third-party ad settings.
