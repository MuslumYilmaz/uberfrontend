  "description": "Design a dashboard that updates in real time with model training progress: metrics, logs, and run status. Focus on streaming data into the UI, keeping it responsive under frequent updates, and handling reconnects or backpressure.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Live progress bars, charts, and logs.\n- WebSocket/SSE vs polling and update cadence.\n- Buffering, throttling, and list virtualization.\n- Error states, reconnect logic, and stale data handling.\n\nYou should be prepared to talk about: data flow from stream to UI, data model for metrics/logs, and how you keep the interface fast during bursts.",
