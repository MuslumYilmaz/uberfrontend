  "description": "Design a real-time notifications feed for a front-end system design interview. Cover feed architecture, WebSocket/SSE/polling subscriptions, buffering and batching to avoid re-render storms, virtualized list rendering for large feeds, and unread state consistency. Explain how the UI stays fast under bursty traffic, reconnects, and slow devices.\n\nFunctional requirements:\n- Receive new notifications in real time (push or polling).\n- Render a scrollable feed with new items appearing at the top.\n- Support read/unread state, clear-all, and basic filtering (e.g., only mentions).\n- Show a badge/count for unseen notifications.\n- Handle network errors and reconnects gracefully.\n\nNon-functional:\n- Avoid re-render storms when bursts of events arrive.\n- Keep memory and DOM size bounded (virtualization, trimming).\n- Maintain smooth scrolling (60 FPS target).\n- Be resilient to slow devices and unstable networks.\n- INP <= 200ms for panel interactions.\n\nData / state considerations:\n- Notification objects include id, type, content, timestamp, read/unread, and optional actions.\n- A small client-side buffer queues incoming events before render.\n- A view model layer maintains a bounded list (latest N) plus metadata like unreadCount and lastSeenCursor.\n",
