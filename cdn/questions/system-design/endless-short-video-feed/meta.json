    "description": "Design a TikTok-style endless short-video feed for a front-end system design interview. Use the RADIO approach to structure your answer: Reflect, Assumptions, Decide, Implement, Outcome.\n\nFocus on fast first play, smooth scrolling, preloading the next videos, adaptive quality, and graceful handling of slow networks. Discuss caching, CDN delivery, memory control, playback lifecycle, and UI performance budgets.\n\nFunctional requirements:\n- Autoplay the current video with minimal startup delay.\n- Preload the next 1-3 videos without exhausting memory.\n- Support pause/resume, mute, and basic controls.\n- Handle variable network conditions (Wi-Fi vs 4G).\n- Keep the feed responsive during rapid scrolling.\n\nNon-functional:\n- Time-to-first-frame <= 1.0s on Wi-Fi, <= 2.0s on 4G.\n- Stable frame rate (no jank during scroll).\n- Bounded memory usage across long sessions.\n- Graceful degradation on slow networks.\n- Strong observability for playback success and UX.\n",
