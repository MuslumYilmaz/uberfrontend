The '+' button increments the ref, the '−' button decrements but is guarded so the value never becomes negative, and 'Reset' sets it back to 0.\n\n**Key ideas**\n- Store count in a single `ref`.\n- Derive disabled state from a `computed` value.\n- Guard the decrement so it never sets a negative value.",

Define a computed property `isZero` that checks `count.value === 0` and bind it to `:disabled` on the decrement button. Implement `inc`, `dec`, and `reset` as simple functions that mutate `count.value`, with `dec` checking that the value is greater than 0 before decrementing."
